# Rainfall-42

## 🚀 Project Summary
This project introduces you to ELF binary exploitation on i386 systems.

Rainfall is a tougher challenge than Snow Crash. You'll reverse engineer, analyze, and find vulnerabilities to reach the final level. Ready to hack?

## 🛠 Usage
- Run the .iso in a VM
- Explore, reverse engineer, and exploit your way through the levels

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Basic hacking tools (e.g., GDB, radare2, strings) — use what you need!

## 🎯 Goal
Learn to spot and fix security flaws, understand RAM, and build safer programs. This is your journey to becoming a better developer and security-aware coder!
